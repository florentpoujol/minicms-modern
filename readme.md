# Mini CMS - Modern

The point of this project is to practice back-end web developement with PHP, by creating a basic CMS with __modern__ practices:
- OOP and ideally no strictly procedural code (ie: no global helper functions),
- MVC, plus the single `index.php` front controller and all other `.php` files outside of the web root ,
- use some of the [PHP Standard Components](https://github.com/florentpoujol/PHP-Standard-Components) (that I also created myself),
- no framework or non-native libraries (except for my Standard Components of course, as well as Markdown, PHP Mailer and PHPUnit)

An online demo version is available at [https://minicmsmodern.florentpoujol.fr](https://minicmsmodern.florentpoujol.fr).

_See also [MINI CMS - Old-School - Vanilla](https://github.com/florentpoujol/minicms-osv), the same kind of project but completely procedural, without specific organisation of files and no libraries._

## Install

Require PHP7.0+ and MySQL5.6+.

- Clone the repo or upload and extract the .zip from github's download.
- Set the root of the virtual host to the public folder.
- Make sure the `App\views`, `config` and `public/uploads` folders are writable
- Access the site, which redirects you to the install page, fill out the required information (especially the database access), then if there is no error, you are good to go !

If you have any unexpected errors, or something doesn't seem to go right during the installation, make sure to delete the `config/config.json` file before trying again.

You will be redirected to the login page once the installation is complete.

If you need to update the configuration, you can either access the Config page via the admin menu (only admin users can do that), or directly edit the `config/config.json` file.

To run the tests, edit the database information in the `tests\testsConfig.json` file, then run `php vendor/bin/phpunit` from the root folder.
